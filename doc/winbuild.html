<h2>Graphviz Build Instructions for Windows</h2>
<P>
(Graphviz versions &gt;= 2.3)
<P>
Currently we build Graphviz on Windows using the MS Visual C++ 6.0 compiler 
only. The simplest way to build the software from source on Windows is as 
follows:
<OL>
<LI>
Download the Windows source package:<BR>Go to
<A HREF=http://www.graphviz.org/Download_windows.php>http://www.graphviz.org/Download_windows.php</A>
and copy over either the release or development source package. 
At present, these can also be found as
<A HREF=http://www.graphviz.org/pub/graphviz/ARCHIVE/graphviz-win.tgz>http://www.graphviz.org/pub/graphviz/ARCHIVE/graphviz-win.tgz</A> and
<A HREF=http://www.graphviz.org/pub/graphviz/CURRENT/graphviz-win.tgz>http://www.graphviz.org/pub/graphviz/CURRENT/graphviz-win.tgz</A>, respectively.
</LI>
<SPACER TYPE=VERTICAL SIZE=10>
<LI>
Unwrap the package:<BR>
If you have Unix tools available, you can use
<SPACER TYPE=VERTICAL SIZE=10>
<TT>gunzip < graphviz-win.tgz | tar xf -</TT><BR>
<SPACER TYPE=VERTICAL SIZE=10>
If not, double click on the file and WinZip should start up and let you
store all of the files into a directory.<BR>
Let <TT>$ROOT</TT> be the directory in which you stored the Graphviz source.
</LI>
<SPACER TYPE=VERTICAL SIZE=10>
<LI>
Add the third-party libraries:  
<SPACER TYPE=VERTICAL SIZE=10>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI>
zlib 1.1.3 <A HREF=http://www.gzip.org/zlib/>http://www.gzip.org/zlib/</A>
<LI>
libpng 1.0.6 <A HREF=http://www.libpng.org/pub/png>http://www.libpng.org/pub/png</A> 
<LI>
jpeg-6b 62 <A HREF=http://www.ijg.org/>http://www.ijg.org/</A>
<LI>
freetype 2.1.7 <A HREF=http://freetype.sourceforge.net/>http://freetype.sourceforge.net/</A>
<LI>
expat <A HREF=http://expat.sourceforge.net/>http://expat.sourceforge.net/</A>
</UL>
<SPACER TYPE=VERTICAL SIZE=10>
The versions should be at least the ones indicated.
You can download the files from 
<a href=http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/dist/third-party.zip>http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/dist/third-party.zip</a>.
Unzip the package in the <TT>$ROOT</TT> directory; this will create a subdirectory called
<TT>third-party</TT>.
Or you can obtain the libraries yourself, and install 
them in <TT>$ROOT\third-party</TT>
Also note that these libraries come with the binary release.
</LI>
<SPACER TYPE=VERTICAL SIZE=10>
<LI>
Build the software in one of the following ways:<BR>  
<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI> Run the script <TT>$ROOT\build.bat</TT> while in the <TT>$ROOT</TT> 
directory. You'll first want to check
that the <TT>vc</TT> variable points to your local installation of visual C.
Obviously, this should be run in a DOS command window.
<LI> The file <TT>$ROOT\ws\graphviz.dsw</TT> 
is the main workspace for the Graphviz libraries and graph drawing programs.
The file
<TT>$ROOT\ws\tools.dsw</TT> provides the workspace for the
additional Graphviz tools. Double-clicking on these files will open the
workspaces using the MS Visual Studio, from which you can use the Build
menu item to create the various libraries and programs. 
<PP>
Note that we have avoided all dependencies (i.e., there are no .dep files)
because we found they tended to include absolute pathnames.
If necessary, follow the order used in <TT>build.bat</TT> to be safe.
<LI> If you have a Unix environment, with a real ksh, run the script 
<TT>$ROOT\wmake.sh</TT>
after setting the PATH, LIB and INCLUDE shell variables to the paths where
the Visual C programs are installed on your machine, and the associated
library and include file directories.
</UL>
</OL>
<P> Once built, all of the libraries and programs will be found in
either the Release or Debug subdirectory of the corresponding source
directory. If you wish to install
the software somewhere, edit the file <TT>$ROOT\install.bat</TT> to
set the variable <TT>root</TT> to be the absolute pathname of the
directory where you want
the software installed, and then run the script <TT>$ROOT\install.bat</TT>
from the <TT>$ROOT</TT> directory.
<P>
If you want to change source files, you can just do it and rebuild.
If, however, you want to add new files or projects, you will
have to redo the makefiles or scripts.
